description: "Why I use Ionic Framework"

I've started playing around with [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) again just recently.

I was introduced to Ionic by a friend way back before when it is still using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
Personally, I think that this framework is really cool! Back then I was already into Javascript, CSS, HTML stuff and the idea that by using the same things, you can already develop a mobile app has really got me into using Ionic!

Don't expect too much! Yes, I did create a "lot" of apps but most of them are still sitting in my laptop or worse, has already been deleted. I did try to deploy some of my "finished" apps on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
What I'm saying here is that, building and deploying a mobile app using Ionic Framework is beginner-friendly. Even the documentation in the site has improved a lot compared to the previous years.

So, if you currently have a mobile app idea and wanting to create a POC(proof of concept), you might want to consider using [Ionic Framework.](https://ionicframework.com/)

And, that would be all for now. Until the next article! See yah!

<!--
PS: Maybe put in another article :)
Deploying on Google Play Store was easier and cheaper compared to Apple App Store. Creating a developer account on Google Play Store only cost $25(one-time), which on Apple App Store it cost $100/year!
