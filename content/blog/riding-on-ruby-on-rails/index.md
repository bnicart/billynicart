[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is one of those web frameworks which immediately caught my attention and liking.
From very simple codes to complex-yet-functional [gems,](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) one can start building web application fast!

I first encountered Ruby on Rails(RoR) from my work back in 2014. It was the required framework that we'll be using in building a web application for our client. At first, I was really coding much in RoR. I know some basic concepts but wasn't really applying them. I was assigned on doing the frontend part using [AngularJS.](https://angularjs.org/) When given some opportunity, I started doing backend stuffs.
Putting up new API endpoints and integrating them on the frontend, doing some business-logic updates & eventually new features. For a web developer, it's a fulfilling to see your work live and being used by people.

Fast-forward to present days, I still can't say that I'm an expert in using RoR. I still have a long way to go in order to reach that stage. But nonetheless, I'll still personally recommend [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) to aspiring web developers!

And, that would be all for now. Until the next article! See yah!
